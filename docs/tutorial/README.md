# AI CodeMentor - Tutorials

## Getting started with AI CodeMentor

* To write your own workflow - that is to create your own application with AI-Agents - you just need to write Markfown files and put them into the [/workflows](../../workflows/) directory.  
If you need to learn Markdown, you may want to use this tutorial: https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/

* The control-flow is also defined within that Markdown file, using the Mermaid plugin, which renders the text-definition into an easy to read and understand grafik.  
You want to learn more about Mermaid? You may use: https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html

* The Sourcefiles to all lessons are in the [../../workflows/tutorial/](../../workflows/tutorial/) subdirectory.
